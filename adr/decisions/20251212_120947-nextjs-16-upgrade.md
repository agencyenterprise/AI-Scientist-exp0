# 20251212_120947-nextjs-16-upgrade

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The frontend was running on an older version of Next.js. Upgrading to Next.js 16 provides access to latest features, performance improvements, and security patches. The upgrade also aligns with React 19 compatibility requirements.

**Source commits:**

- fb5a7b3: upgrade to nextjs 16

## Decision

Upgraded the frontend to Next.js 16 with the following changes:

- Updated `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` to latest compatible versions
- Removed unused React default imports (no longer needed in React 19)
- Updated related dependencies (`@img/sharp`, `libvips`, etc.)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Access to latest Next.js features and optimizations
- Improved performance and bundle size
- Security patches and bug fixes
- Full React 19 compatibility

### Negative

- Potential breaking changes from major version bump
- Dependencies may need updates for compatibility
- Team needs to learn new APIs/patterns

### Constraints

- Remove unused React default imports (`import React from 'react'` no longer needed)
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Next.js 16
- Test SSR/SSG behavior after upgrade
- Verify image optimization still works with updated sharp/libvips
